Generate multiple `.fasta` files based on sites/regions from an alignment

Mainly for viral phylogenies, discordant trees etc.

Practicing python package development from [here](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html)

## Further work

All hardcoded - not so useful. Probably generate a partition file and extract regions from there?
